.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the messages
.Ar msgs
where the value of
.Ar header
matches the POSIX Extended Regular Expression
.Ar regex .
.Pp
If
.Ar header
is empty,
.Nm
will instead match against the Maildir flags of the messages.
.Pp
If
.Ar header
is
.Sq Li "/" ,
.Nm
will instead search the plain text parts of the
.Em body
of the messages.
.Pp
See
.Xr mmsg 7
for the message argument syntax.
If no
.Ar msgs
are passed, and
.Nm
is used interactively,
.Nm
will default to the current sequence.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a

Match
.Ar regex
case insensitively.

is specified.
.It Fl p
Print matching messages
.Ar msgs ,
the matching line and the header.
If

quit as soon as possible.
